# Kef's Old English dictionary

This project is currently a work in progress and not yet particularly functional or usable. It's a toy project and might never be more than that. It is inspired in large part by Whitaker's Words (https://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/words.htm), and compiled mainly as a way to study the language rather than out of any particular need for a new dictionary.

It stands on the shoulders of giants: much of the content is derived, directly or indirectly, from various sources, especially Wiktionary and Bosworth-Toller. Non-copyrightable elements have also been taken from resources such as _An Old English Grammar_ by Quirk and Wrynn.

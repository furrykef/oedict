Preterite-present verbs

More strong verbs with irregular infinitives

dæġ, dagas

fugol and lȳtel should contract in inflected forms

fyxen should have -nn- in forms other than nominative

gōd: don't generate adverbial forms (or else add a way to provide the comparative and superlative of "wel")

sǣ can be masc. or fem. with different irregular declensions

hātan has a passive form (iċ hātte, þū hāttest, hē hātte, wē hātton), which we should probably consider a separate, defective verb.

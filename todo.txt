Parse specials for adjectives

More strong verbs with irregular infinitives

Inflected forms of present and past participles

an/on folding: "monn" should look up "mann", but "ston" should not look up "stān"

Match lufiġan for lufian, etc.

Forms such as sċipu

"hall" wrongly pulls up "hāl"

bint, not bindþ, etc.

nm.sg, nn.sg, nf.sg (e.g. "feoh")

Specials for adjectives like masc.acc.sg

Verify all vs7 verbs conjugate correctly


bā: what part of speech?

brōþor: make sure brōþer- vs. brōþr- is consistent in both special and generated forms (note that, I believe, broþeru is attested but perhaps e.g. sweosteru is not)

dæġ, dagas

fugol and lȳtel should contract in inflected forms

glæd, but se glada catt

gōd: don't generate adverbial forms (or else add a way to provide the comparative and superlative of "wel")

maniġ, mā, mǣst: but these latter two are indeclinable and take the genitive, so they're not true comparative and superlative forms.

hātan has a passive form (iċ hātte, þū hāttest, hē hātte, wē hātton), which we should probably consider a separate, defective verb.

sǣ can be masc. or fem. with different irregular declensions

sunu, wudu

þætte should redirect only to the conjunction form of þæt

þonne: replace with þanne?

wealh should lose its h in inflected forms

wōh's declension

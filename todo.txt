Parse specials for adjectives
Specials for adjectives like masc.acc.sg

More strong verbs with irregular infinitives

Inflected forms of present and past participles

Match lufiġan for lufian, etc.

Forms such as sċipu

"hall" wrongly pulls up "hāl"

nm.sg, nn.sg, nf.sg (e.g. "feoh")

Verify all vs7 verbs conjugate correctly

cȳþan's past tense is cȳþde *or* cȳdde

Are there any -ttan verbs that conjugate like fremman?

Don't index silly forms like sweryan

pp ġehīered, not ġehīerd


bā: what part of speech?

brōþor: make sure brōþer- vs. brōþr- is consistent in both special and generated forms (note that, I believe, broþeru is attested but perhaps e.g. sweosteru is not)

fugol, lȳtel, wæter, and others should contract in inflected forms

glæd, but se glada catt

gōd: don't generate adverbial forms (or else add a way to provide the comparative and superlative of "wel")

maniġ, mā, mǣst: but these latter two are indeclinable and take the genitive, so they're not true comparative and superlative forms.

hātan has a passive form (iċ hātte, þū hāttest, hē hātte, wē hātton), which we should probably consider a separate, defective verb.

sǣ can be masc. or fem. with different irregular declensions

þætte should redirect only to the conjunction form of þæt

wōh

weġ, wegas

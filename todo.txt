Preterite-present verbs

More strong verbs with irregular infinitives

Inflected forms of present and past participles

an/on folding: "monn" should look up "mann", but "ston" should not look up "stān"

Match lufiġan for lufian, etc.


Forms such as sċipu

dæġ, dagas

fugol and lȳtel should contract in inflected forms

fyxen should have -nn- in forms other than nominative

gōd: don't generate adverbial forms (or else add a way to provide the comparative and superlative of "wel")

hātan has a passive form (iċ hātte, þū hāttest, hē hātte, wē hātton), which we should probably consider a separate, defective verb.

sǣ can be masc. or fem. with different irregular declensions

þætte should redirect only to the conjunction form of þæt

wealh should lose its h in inflected forms

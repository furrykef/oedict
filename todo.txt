Generate comparative and superlative of adjectives and adverbs

Generate adverbs from adjectives (only if "adv" field not supplied)

Parse specials for adjectives
Specials for adjectives like masc.acc.sg

More strong verbs with irregular infinitives

Inflected forms of present and past participles

Match lufiġan for lufian, etc.

Forms such as sċipu

"hall" wrongly pulls up "hāl"

nm.sg, nn.sg, nf.sg (e.g. "feoh")
nm.pl, nn.pl, nf.pl (e.g. "ġeardagas")

Verify all vs7 verbs conjugate correctly

vs5 verbs with -ie- stems

cȳþan's past tense is cȳþde *or* cȳdde

Are there any -ttan verbs that conjugate like fremman?

pp ġehīered, not ġehīerd

Declension of cardinal numerals, including above þrēo (see Quirk & Wrenn)

Don't generate adverbial forms of numbers, whether adverbial

Numerals in -feald (twifeald, etc.)


Respect vowel length, diacritics, etc. when following redirects

Add a way to optionally specify part of speech when following redirects


The code to generate variants is a bit of a joke right now. It generates many implausible forms and probably misses many plausible ones.

Don't generate silly forms like sweryan, or lufi (from 'lufie').

'stem' special for adjectives (e.g. "hēah")

Forms such as hīereþ (as opposed to hīerþ)


brōþor: make sure brōþer- vs. brōþr- is consistent in both special and generated forms (note that, I believe, broþeru is attested but perhaps e.g. sweosteru is not)

ġehwelc (and ġehwilc)

glæd, smæl

gōd: don't generate adverbial forms (or else add a way to provide the comparative and superlative of "wel")

maniġ, mā, mǣst: but these latter two are indeclinable and take the genitive, so they're not true comparative and superlative forms.

miċle, yfle, etc: don't generate adverbial forms for their comparative and superlative

hātan has a passive form (iċ hātte, þū hāttest, hē hātte, wē hātton), which we should probably consider a separate, defective verb.

hwelċhwugu (and hwilċhwugu)

sǣ can be masc. or fem. with different irregular declensions

twigu: ensure its "g" is hard

þætte should redirect only to the conjunction form of þæt

weċġan

weġ, wegas

wōh
